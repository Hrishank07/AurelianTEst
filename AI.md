# AI Usage Disclosure

For total transparency and "Speed over Perfection," I utilized AI tools (Antigravity and Chatgpt) to accelerate the boilerplate generation for this assessment.

**Where I used AI:**

1. **Boilerplate Generation:** Generating the initial Pydantic models and SQLAlchemy definitions for the `FormSubmission` table to match the provided specs.
2. **Frontend Syntax:** Quickly generating the React `useEffect` and `fetch` syntax to wire up the API calls in the UI.
3. **Debugging:** Analyzing the traceback when the provided boilerplate code failed to execute the tool calls correctly.

**Where I did NOT use AI:**

1. **System Architecture:** The decision to use a polymorphic design for Task 3 was based on my personal experience with distributed systems.
2. **Logic & Validation:** The error handling, status validation logic, and the decision to refactor the tool execution flow were manual engineering decisions.
